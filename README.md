# Music Organizer

This is a simple application that I built for myself to easily track my music collection and sync albums back and forth to my iPod.
I found this project very valuable for learning Go because it allowed me to explore many aspects of the language including
database interactions, file system operations, concurrency with goroutines, and other common programming tasks.


Tools Used:
- Go (with the Wails framework)
- Svelte
- Sqlite
